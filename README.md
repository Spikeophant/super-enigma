# Super Enigma - A personal Weather Dashboard

## Description

A quick, easy to use, weather dashboard.  Only displays current, and 5-Day forecast.  Mostly responsive layout.  Very
nice change of pace from wunderground and similar slow to load sites.  Available at [https://spikeophant.github.io/super-enigma/](https://spikeophant.github.io/super-enigma/)
A couple minor graphical issues that could be worked out with time.
